            <h2><a href="">Infrastructure as Code</a></h2>
            <p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through 			machine- readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration 			tools.[1] Both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines and associated 		configuration resources are called "infrastructure", although they have nothing to do with actual 			infrastructure. The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative 			definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative 			approaches..</p>
